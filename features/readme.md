Here are some of the features of the [rails3-mongoid-devise](https://github.com/railsapps/rails3-mongoid-devise) example app.

The example app combines [Mongoid](http://mongoid.org/) with [Devise](http://github.com/plataformatec/devise). Mongoid is a datastore that gives you quick development without schemas or migrations. Devise gives you ready-made authentication and user management.

The [rails3-mongoid-devise](https://github.com/railsapps/rails3-mongoid-devise) app is on GitHub.

The features are described in the Gherkin format used by the Cucumber software project which means they can be read as plain English descriptions and processed by Cucumber for acceptance testing. If you have ideas to clarify or improve any of these features, please submit a [GitHub issue](http://github.com/railsapps/rails3-mongoid-devise/issues) or pull request.
